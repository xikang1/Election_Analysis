## Election Audit Summary
Since all other elections have the similiar mode to count the votes and calculate the vote percentage, we could applied our model to other election by some modifications. All we need to change is the name of the parameter and the print statement. For example, if we are having a team leader election and we have five candidates. After imporint the new data, we are going to read data from each row and save the values to our new dictionary with the "key" candidate name and "value" number of votes for each of them. By using the same code we can easily have the election result with the number of votes, vote percentage and the winning candidate by modifying the print statment. The same idea can also applied for election of the favortie sutdent in the class. We can have the potential candidate with their vote saved in the dictionary by reading the data from the Excel worksheet, we can also have the statistical data with the number of votes and vote percentage for each candidate by using the same python code. we could easily have the result printed on the screen or saved in the result text file. Overall, the countting and calculation process are the same, this program can be used for any other election by changing the variable names, print statement accordingly.
